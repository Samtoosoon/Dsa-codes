A person is eligible to vote if his/her age is greater than or equal to 18. Define a function to find out if he/she is eligible to vote

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool check_eligibility(int age) {
    return age >= 18;
}

int main() {
    int age;
    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;
    if (check_eligibility(age)) {
        cout << "You are eligible to vote." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "You are not eligible to vote." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
